        <h2 id="Managed">Managed vs Unmanaged</h2>
        <div class="well">
            <p>fTelnet comes in both Managed and Unmanaged versions, and I can't stress enough how much I recommend using the managed version.</p>
            <p>Why do I recommend the managed version?  Because it's pretty much foolproof (no offense intended!), and doesn't require you to keep anything up to date, I do all that for you.</p>
            <p>So if you want to stop reading now and go try the managed version instead, head on over to the <a href="http://embed-v2.ftelnet.ca/">Embed Wizard</a>.  Seriously, you'll be up and running in under 5 minutes.  It's awesome.</p>

            <hr />

            <p>I see you're still reading, so I guess you don't want to use the managed version...that sucks because I put a lot of effort into getting that up and running!</p>
            <p>Anyway, before you 100% decide which version to run, check of these differences:</p>

                    <td>I'm there for you, but if it sounds like you didn't RTFM, or if you're in way over your head, my answer to your support request may be <strong>Use the Managed version!</strong></td>

        <h2 id="Support">How to get support</h2>
        <div class="well">
            <p>The <a href="https://www.ftelnet.ca/contact/">fTelnet contact page</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/rickparrish/fTelnet/issues">GitHub Issues page</a> are the two best ways to get ahold of me.</p>

        <h2 id="Install">How to install</h2>
        <div class="well">
            <p>Installing is pretty simple.  If you're reading this that means you've already downloaded and extracted the archive, so just put all these files into an fTelnet directory on your webserver and you're good to go.</p>

        <h2 id="Use">How to use</h2>
        <div class="well">
            <p>Using fTelnet is almost as easy as installing it was.  First you need to include the correct files.  Assuming you have an index.html in your document root, and fTelnet in a subdirectory called fTelnet, you can do that by putting this in your &lt;body> section where you want the client to appear:</p>
            <code>
&lt;div id="fTelnetContainer">&lt;/div><br />
&lt;script src="ftelnet.norip.noxfer.min.js" id="fTelnetScript">&lt;/script><br />
&lt;script><br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; var Options = new fTelnetOptions();<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Options.Hostname = "bbs.ftelnet.ca";<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Options.Port = 1123;<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; var Client = new fTelnetClient('fTelnetContainer', Options);<br />
&lt;/script><br />
            </code>
            <p>That should now get you up and running.</p>

        <h2 id="Customize">How to customize</h2>
        <div class="well">
            <p>Ahh, now we get to the meat of the document.  You've installed fTelnet, you've got it up and running, and now you want to customize it (what, you mean you DIDN'T want it to just connect to my server?!?)</p>
            <p>So here's a complete (at the time of this writing, hopefully I'll remember to keep it up to date in the future!) list of variables that you can customize.  You should assign values to these variables right before you call fTelnet.Init().  You should be able to assign them after you call fTelnet.Init(), but some of them may cause flicker (ie font or screen size changes), so best to do it before.</p>

            <p>Internet Explorer 8 (and older) do not support the Canvas element, and while there are polyfills, none of them have support for the features fTelnet needs.  So unfortunately IE8 (and older) will never be supported.</p>
